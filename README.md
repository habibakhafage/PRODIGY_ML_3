# Image Classification: Cats vs. Dogs



## Image Classification Overview

**Image classification** is a crucial computer vision task that involves assigning predefined labels to images. It is widely used in **object recognition, face detection, medical image analysis, and more**.

## Project Overview
During my internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**, I worked on an **image classification** task to distinguish between **cats and dogs** using a **Support Vector Machine (SVM) model**. This project involved data handling, model building, and evaluation to optimize classification performance.

## Key Steps in the Project

### 1. Data Handling
- Downloaded and extracted the dataset from Kaggle.
- Organized images into separate folders for **cats** and **dogs**.

### 2. Initial SVM Model
- Implemented an initial **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model.
- The accuracy was lower than expected, prompting further optimization.

### 3. Pipeline Enhancement
- Developed a pipeline incorporating **StandardScaler** for feature scaling.
- Combined the **SVM model** with preprocessing techniques to improve classification accuracy.

### 4. Model Testing
- Evaluated both the **initial SVM model** and the **pipeline-enhanced model** on a test subset.
- The initial model misclassified some images, while the pipeline **correctly classified both cats and dogs** due to improved accuracy.

### 5. External Test Evaluation
- Tested the pipeline on an **external dataset of ~12,000 images**.
- Successfully validated the improved model's performance.

This project highlighted the **importance of data preprocessing and pipeline optimization** in achieving **higher classification accuracy**.
